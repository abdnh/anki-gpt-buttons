# GPT Buttons

This Anki add-on allows you to add customizable editor buttons and browser actions to fill in notes using [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s GPT models.

You'll need an [OpenAI API key](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) to be able to use the add-on.

Buttons can either work on prompts pulled from configured fields (this type of buttons are called "Field buttons"),
or on prompts defined directly in the config ("Preset buttons"). You can configure multiple fields to parse the output into and other options.
All configured buttons are also accessible from the browser's _Edit > GPT_ menu for bulk operations on selected notes.

Check the add-on [config](src/config.md) under _Tools > Add-ons > Config_ for detailed description of the options.

_This add-on is currently in beta. Testing and feedback are appreciated._
